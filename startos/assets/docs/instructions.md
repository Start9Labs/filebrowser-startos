# Usage Instructions

1. Copy/paste your File Browser Tor address into any Tor-enabled browser.
2. Insert your default username and password. These are located in `Properties`.
3. Bookmark the site for future visits, or better yet, save it to your Bitwarden server!
4. Optionally change your default username/password. Please note, this change **will not** be reflected in the `Properties` section mentioned above.
5. If you accidentally lock yourself out, the "Reset Root User" action will reset your username and password.
