# File Browser

## Getting Started

1. Copy/paste your ".onion" URL into any Tor-enabled browser. Options include:
   * Start9 Consulate (highly recommended)
   * Tor Browser
   * Firefox (with SOCKS5 proxy enabled)
   * Brave
2. Insert your default username and password. These are located in the "Properties" section of your Embassy File Browser service.
3. Bookmark the site for future visits, or better yet, save it to your Bitwarden server!
4. Optionally change your default username/password. Please note, this change **will not** be reflected in the "Properties" section mentioned above.

_If you update your username or password and forget either one of them, you will be permanently locked out of your File Browser server. **There is no password recovery!** We recommend either (1) not changing the defaults **OR** (2) using Bitwarden with proper backups._
